Code organisation

class twitter_user (similar to point) holds ratings vector
class tweets  :
  contains all the maps , vectors

  first all the data, the lexicon, the term -> crypto mappings
  and the tweets are proccessed by the tweets class
  then we have 3 options
  1: run_lsh , which runs the usual lsh neighbours and top 5 currencies UJ
  2: run_clustering, which runs the top 2 cryptos using CJ
  3: run_user_clustering, which does the same as the 1st but doing clustering
    instead of lsh buckets
